# README

This project contains the documentation for hybrid-cloud-patterns.io

The directory structure is pretty straightforward. The images dir are where images used in the documentation are loaded and referenced. Each validated pattern receives its own directory that includes an index.md file and any other files needed to explain the pattern.

The project colors are:

- Grey #2D3B44
- Orange #C77038
- Blue #1D639D

and an animated logo of the Sierpinski triangle.

Individual patterns have a Sierpinski triangle logo with their own color scheme, and the number of triangles represents the number of major revisions.
